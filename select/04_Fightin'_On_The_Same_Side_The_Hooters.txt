Here we are on the battlefield
A civil war is all each other feels
Oh yeah, you say blue and I say gray
But we know love ain't love if it fades away
Oh, don't let it fade away

Just leave these troubles behind
And break down all the battle lines
Open up your eyes girl
We're fightin' on the same side

Oh, here we are on the battlefield
Wounded by the words that cut so deep
Oh yeah, well I can't give if you won't take
Maybe we're just afraid that it's too late
Oh, well I know it's not too late

So leave these troubles behind
And break down all the battle lines
Open up your eyes girl
We're fightin' on the same side

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
(Come on baby)
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
(Yeah each and everyday)

We're both soldiers of the heart
Fightin' for the dream that fell apart
Oh yeah, we both know this war is real
Surrender to the way we used to feel
Oh, I miss the way we used to feel

So leave these troubles behind
And break down all the battle lines
Open up your eyes girl
We're fightin' on the same side
Open up your eyes girl
We're fightin' on the same side
We're fightin' on the same side

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
(Come on baby)
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
(Yeah each and everyday)

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
(Just open up your eyes)
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
(We're fightin' on the same side)

Just open up your eyes, girl
We're fightin' on the same side
Just open up your eyes
We're fightin' on the same side
